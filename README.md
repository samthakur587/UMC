# Unbiased multivariate correlation analysis (UMC) Computation

This project provides a framework to compute the Unbiased multivariate correlation analysis (UMC) for a given dataset.

## Introduction

Implemented the python code for the research paper [UMC](https://github.com/samthakur587/UMC/blob/main/UMC_paper.pdf) is a measure used in various applications including data analysis, feature selection, and more. The goal is to compute the contribution of each column (or dimension) in a dataset.
## Features

- Compute the Conditional Entropy (CE) for arrays.
- Rank columns based on their CE values.
- Form initial bins for data based on distinct values.
- Create hypercubes from the data.
- Extract values based on keys from the map.
- Compute the main UMC score for the dataset.

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- numpy
- math

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed.
3. Import the `UMCFunction` class from the main module.
4. Create an instance of the `UMCFunction` class.
5. Call the `computeScore` method on your dataset.

Example:

```python
from UMCFunction import UMCFunction
import numpy as np

data = np.array([[...], [...], ...])
umc_instance = UMCFunction()
score = umc_instance.computeScore(data=data)
print(score)
```
